# Week 0: Solar Data Analysis Challenge Report

## Introduction

This report documents my journey through Week 0 of the Kifiya Challenge, where I worked on analyzing solar radiation data from three West African countries. The challenge involved setting up a development environment, performing data analysis, and creating an interactive dashboard.

## Task 1: Git & Environment Setup

### Initial Setup

I began by creating a new GitHub repository named `kifiya-challenge-week0` and setting up the development environment. The initial setup included:

1. **Repository Structure**

   - Created the required folder structure
   - Set up `.gitignore` to exclude data files and environment-specific files
   - Initialized Python virtual environment

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Created `requirements.txt` with necessary dependencies
   - Set up VS Code settings for Python development
   - Configured GitHub Actions for CI/CD

### Challenges Faced

- **Dependency Conflicts**: Initially faced issues with package version compatibility, particularly with `statsmodels` and `plotly`
- **Solution**: Created a new virtual environment and carefully specified package versions in `requirements.txt`

### Key Achievements

- Successfully set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Implemented proper Git workflow with feature branches
- Created comprehensive documentation in README.md

## Task 2: Data Profiling & EDA

### Data Analysis Approach

For each country (Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo), I performed comprehensive EDA:

1. **Data Cleaning**

   - Handled missing values using median imputation
   - Removed outliers using IQR method
   - Validated data consistency

2. **Exploratory Analysis**
   - Created time series visualizations
   - Analyzed correlations between variables
   - Generated distribution plots

### Technical Implementation

- Created utility functions in `utils.py` for common operations
- Implemented automated data cleaning pipeline
- Developed visualization functions for consistent analysis

### Challenges

- **Memory Issues**: Large datasets caused memory problems during processing
- **Solution**: Implemented chunked processing and optimized data types

## Task 3: Cross-Country Comparison

### Analysis Methodology

1. **Statistical Analysis**

   - Performed ANOVA tests to compare countries
   - Generated summary statistics
   - Created comparative visualizations

2. **Key Findings**
   - Identified Sierra Leone as the optimal location
   - Discovered significant temperature variations
   - Analyzed wind patterns and their impact

### Dashboard Development

Created an interactive Streamlit dashboard with:

- Country selection widgets
- Dynamic visualizations
- Summary statistics table

### Challenges

- **Streamlit Deployment**: Faced issues with dependency management
- **Solution**: Created a separate `requirements.txt` for the dashboard
