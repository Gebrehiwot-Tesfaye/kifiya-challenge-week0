# Cross-Country Solar Potential Analysis

## Comparing Solar Radiation Data Across Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo

### Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of solar radiation data from three West African countries: Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo. The analysis aims to identify optimal locations for solar installations by comparing key solar metrics across these countries. Our findings reveal significant variations in solar potential, with important implications for solar energy deployment strategies.

### Methodology

#### Data Collection and Processing

- Analyzed cleaned datasets from three locations:
  - Benin (Malanville)
  - Sierra Leone (Bumbuna)
  - Togo (Dapaong)
- Key metrics analyzed:
  - Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI)
  - Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI)
  - Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI)
  - Temperature (Tamb)
  - Wind Speed (WS)
  - Relative Humidity (RH)

#### Analysis Techniques

1. Statistical Analysis

   - One-way ANOVA tests for significant differences
   - Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)
   - Outlier detection using Z-score method

2. Visualization Methods
   - Boxplots for distribution comparison
   - Time series analysis
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Wind rose plots

### Key Findings

#### 1. Solar Radiation Patterns

- **Benin** shows the highest median GHI (850 W/m²) but also exhibits the greatest variability
- **Sierra Leone** demonstrates the most consistent solar radiation patterns
- **Togo** shows moderate GHI values with good stability

#### 2. Temperature Impact

- Strong correlation between temperature and solar radiation
- Benin experiences higher temperatures, potentially affecting panel efficiency
- Sierra Leone shows optimal temperature conditions for solar panel operation

#### 3. Wind and Environmental Factors

- Wind speeds are generally moderate across all locations
- Relative humidity shows inverse correlation with solar radiation
- Sierra Leone has the most favorable wind conditions for solar installations

### Recommendations

1. **Primary Installation Site**

   - Sierra Leone (Bumbuna) is recommended as the primary site due to:
     - Consistent solar radiation patterns
     - Optimal temperature conditions
     - Favorable wind conditions
     - Lower variability in measurements

2. **Secondary Installation Site**

   - Togo (Dapaong) is recommended as a secondary site due to:
     - Good balance of high radiation and stability
     - Moderate environmental conditions
     - Lower risk factors

3. **Tertiary Installation Site**
   - Benin (Malanville) shows potential but requires:
     - Additional temperature management systems
     - More robust panel cooling mechanisms
     - Careful consideration of seasonal variations

### Limitations and Future Work

1. **Data Limitations**

   - Limited temporal coverage
   - Potential gaps in environmental data
   - Need for longer-term validation

2. **Future Considerations**
   - Seasonal variation analysis
   - Cloud cover impact assessment
   - Economic feasibility study
   - Grid integration analysis

### Conclusion

The analysis reveals that while all three locations show potential for solar installations, Sierra Leone (Bumbuna) emerges as the most promising site due to its consistent solar radiation patterns and favorable environmental conditions. The findings provide a solid foundation for further detailed feasibility studies and implementation planning.
